## Changes
- Merged `actor.system.attrLeft` and `actor.system.attrTop` into `actor.system.attributes` (#193).
- Added the `position` attribute property, which is used to render an attribute on the actor sheet (#193).
	- It is now possible to have hidden attributes and easier for custom actor sheets to have right/bottom attributes.

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Modules/macros should replace `attrLeft` and `attrTop` for `attributes` on actor sheets and other code that handles attributes.

### Under the Hood Changes
- Moved `Actor#baseType` getter to the actor's Data Model.
- `Actor#sheetType` getter now returns the actor's type if no customType is defined.
- Moved data prepation from the Actor's Document to the Data Model.

## Fixes
- Fixed Playbooks not being migrated to have their actorTypes and Stats set.
- Fixed `creation` moves not being added to "other"-type actors.
- Fixed Item Granting failing to grant items from compendiums (#218).
- Fixed deprecation warnings related to `Math.clamped`'s deprecation.
- Fixed Roll messages not displaying a Stat if its value was 0.

## Changed
- Limited Actor sheets should now have their Playbook CSS.
- Actor Sheet's Description fields now have their key added to CSS. E.g. Biography's `cell cell--bio` is now `cell cell--bio biography`.
- Playbooks' Item Grants now support Babele.
- Sheet Config: Roll attributes now have an optional `showResults` property, which shows/hides results.

## Fixes
- Fixed Playbooks missing from the dropdown list if Babele is active and its hook was missed.
- Fixed Sheet Config warning about cosmetic changes to any attribute with an Array-type `playbook` property.
